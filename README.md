Git is a free and open source software that provides a version control
system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those
files among multiple people.
It is primarily used for source code management in software
development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.
Git stores data as a series of snapshots of the content that has been staged.
This is generally stored in a hidden folder called .git/
